# Sentiment-Driven-Stock-Selector
Stock Sentiment Analysis
This project collects daily headlines for each company in the S&P 500 and performs sentiment analysis on them. It assigns a polarity score to each headline, calculates a score for each company based on the average of the headline scores, and compares it with the percentage change in the stock price from yesterday's closing price to today's open price. The project also provides a graphical representation of the sentiment score versus the percentage change for each company.
